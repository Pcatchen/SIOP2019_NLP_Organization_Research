2,I like that I am learning a new skill set and that it is definitely an important skillset to have in the current economic environment. I also like that I am valued at my workplace because I am one of the few people in the entire company that can do the things that I do. It's fulfilling work but I wish there was a little more to do during the last few days of the week.,It mainly depends on how much work is being thrown my way.

10,"A few things I like about my job - first, job security, because automation is a huge concern across the board, but I don't have to worry about that, because I am literally the one implementing the automation! Second, just by virtue of being a brain-based white collar job, I like that I am in an air conditioned room using my brain - it is comfortable and not physically tiring. And of course it pays pretty well, with good benefits. As far as being a programmer *specifically*, I do like being given interesting problems and it being up to me how to solve them.","This is an impossible question, because I don't experience time passing the exact same amount every day. Plenty of times where I do get absorbed in my work, when I'm deep into coding or implementing something interesting and want to finish it, and realize, huh, hours have passed. Also plenty of times where I'm implementing something complicated but not interesting, like say just a giant pile of similar-but-not-identical conditionals or lookups, or writing documentation, or sitting in meetings, or times where I just don't have work to do, then time passes super slowly.

But in previous jobs I have worked in, some of my managers have been micromanagers and ended up doing more harm than good from a productivity standpoint.Being remote also means that, relative to the area I live, I make a good bit more than average for the type of work that I do. This is because my income is based on the income for the role in home office in New York City, but where I live it goes further than it would in a place like that.","It depends strongly on my workload. The workload for my job comes in waves; sometimes it is slow and I have nothing to do, then I am overwhelmed and working 10+ hour days.

13,"I like interacting with the students who are actually interested and trying to learn. I enjoy being able to talk about interesting things with them. The best thing is when you get to see a kid who was thinking about a concept without understanding it have that moment of realization. I really enjoy working with motivated students who understand why they would want to invest in their education. Those moments are not every moment, but they happen a lot.","It depends on the class period and topic. For example, my physics classes have been working on conservation of energy, which I think is very interesting and somewhat like solving a puzzle. Their class periods go really fast for me, and they also don't have many issues with classroom management. On the other hand, my tech physics class is learning about forces.

16,"My job never lacks meaning -- teaching students is clearly and undoubtedly important work. In addition, I'm certainly never bored. Time flies by; I am looking at the clock wishing I had more time rather than wishing the minutes would hurry by. I am also compensated fairly now that I have worked for nearly 20 years in the same system. I'm also grateful that I don't have to travel (and leave my family) at all for my job. My own kids are in the same building in which I teach, so my job also allows me to interact with them during the day.","For me, time passes quickly when I am teaching. That's not to say that it is easy work, but I generally find myself wishing I could teach just a little more or work with one more student when suddenly the bell rings or the class period ends.

If I'm doing something unfamiliar or something that requires a lot of thought, I find that I tend to get wrapped up in what I'm doing and then I lose track of time.

I can do this by reading industry articles or by attending training via web seminars during my downtime. I also have a sandbox lab where I can develop my skills by playing with different technologies when I have downtime.

29,"I enjoy fixing things that matter.  In my current job, the equipment that I work on is used in important situations where broken equipment could cause large issues.  I also find working on the equipment to be kind of relaxing.  I'm able to work by myself and work through the issues at my own pace.  Whenever a new software patch comes out, I can go to my office and work through all of the systems without interruption.  I also enjoy helping the customer out whenever they have issues.

But, whenever I have a project that I'm working on, time seems to fly by. So, whenever there is a problem on a piece of equipment that I'm fully focused on, an hour can pass in what feels like minutes.   I'd say the focus/distracted aspect is about 50/50 depending on what I'm doing.  If it's something boring, like typing up a report, I'm very easily distracted.  I'll think about something random, like going on vacation, then spend 15 minutes searching for stuff online about the vacation.

53,"I like being able to use my critical thinking skills on a daily basis, I find my job mentally stimulating. My role/job tends to be pretty flexible, so sometimes I am doing one set of tasks and other times I'm doing a totally different set of tasks, and this varies throughout the year and between years as well. It's nice to not be pidgeonholed into being ""the guy who makes tables"" or ""the guy who writes surveys"" and the variety is probably one of the things that really sets my role apart from what is ""normal"" in the market research industry. Working on these different types of projects and tasks means that I don't fall into a really repetitive cycle of doing the same analysis and reporting day-in and day-out.","Really, it's a little bit of everything. I work from home, and I'm pretty good about avoiding external distractions like the TV for the most part, which means that there isn't much in my work environment to distract me. As a result, sometimes time starts to really drag on when I'm doing something that I find un-enjoyable or just mentally taxing. However, I would say that on an average work day, time tends to pass pretty quickly for me. I keep a running to-do list which contains things that need to be completed in the next few months, weeks, and days. Usually if I'm working on something that has a longer timeframe (weeks to months) and time starts to feel like it's passing slowly, I'll switch up tasks to something else to keep myself engaged.

It has become worse in the past year because we used to have a television in the lobby of the motel where I work.  Most of the time, it was either tuned to weather reports, since that is the main concern of guests, or on the down times, we had it tuned to a classic television channel which ran old shows from the 1950s and 60's.  Guests would love to sit and watch a show and reminisce about how they haven't seen the show since they were much younger, or how they might have heard a relative speak of the show but never saw it themselves.

It allows me to feel refreshed and more focused when I go back to working.","Whether or not time goes quickly at work depends on what I am doing and what my workday is going to look like. If I am going to have a lot of meetings and things that I consider a waste of my time, then the day will go slowly.

76,"I work in a public facing job in a library doing tech education for adults. I love planning learning experiences and identifying what technology skills will most improve our patron's lives. I also work a check out desk  several hours a week and enjoy the chance to promote the library's primary mission of freely sharing books, magazines, movies, and more. My favorite task is registering someone for a library card because we do so much and new patrons are always incredibly pleased to learn about everything their library card gives them access to. I also love teaching coding to our advanced learners as that is something that I personally enjoy and I often am able to learn new skills so I can pass them on to our learners.","My job is built around distractions - since my primary base is in a public computer lab you never know what types of question you will get or how long they will take. Patrons can ask any tech question they want, so I might help a business person with their website and turn around and show someone how to use a mouse and keyboard to write a letter and then have to help someone write a resume. There is huge variety to both the tasks and the people you work with, so you are constantly switching gears in your mind. I also work a check-out desk with a similar set up. Each type of setting has a wide variety of tasks you do to help patrons and the walk-up nature of the help makes it impossible to predict if you will be busy or slow. So, if you start a task like writing a handout, planning for a class, processing returned item, etc., you have to drop it if a patron has a question or need assistance. At most, out of a 40 hour week you get 8 hours of desk time -usually split into 30 or 60 minutes at a time. The rest of the time you are on a public desk and work in additional task around patron demands.So, sitting down to focus is hard.

I am allowed to come into work an hour and a half later and stay an hour and a half later. This has allowed me to get some much needed sleep and has improved my health a little bit, in comparison to when I used to work normal hours and come in at office opening time. The flexibility has allowed me to become a little more productive as I am not as exhausted and worn out during the work week. This is one of the few things that I actually like about my job and is something that has helped me to stay afloat in a stressful and relentless work environment.","For the most part, time passes quickly while I am at work because there are not enough hours during the course of the day to get everything done. The work is piled up and the expectations of workload are unrealistic. Thus, time normally moves quickly because I am trying to get a lot of things done by the end of each day and there never seems to be enough hours in the day to get these things done. It is generally neither easy or hard to focus on work tasks that don't involve heavy concentration. Whenever there is work that needs to be done that involves deep focus, it is easy to get distracted because of the foot traffic and distractions in my work environment during the course of the day. An example would be the requirement of reading through reports for grammatical errors. While trying to read through the reports for grammatical errors, the phone rings, e-mail notifications pop up on the screen, the custodians are making lots of noise out in the hallway, the elevator outside of the door beeps all day, there is talking going on outside of the office, and the occupants of the offices next door go in an out 5-10 times an hour, slamming doors often.

This is because the things that I enjoy doing on the technical side of the business are difficult to concentrate on because of competing duties from the customer response, incident response and management side.  Too often I start to work on a project and then will be constantly distracted by incidents that require me to notify management, sit on conference calls that are endless and mostly of little interest to me.   As an example I was modifying a billing application for customers when someone announced that they had a ticket from a customer complaining that their search results for a legal citation were incomplete.   This required me to start running multiple searches to verify the problem.  Since this was beyond my ability to fix I then had to notify the code developers and convene a conference call that I had to sit on and take notes so that I could inform management of progress and impact.   All of this is necessary work but in direct competition for the other parts of my job which were neglected.

I don't know the names of the artists, but a particular example is the ghetto rap heard on the pop radio stations today.",retail/sales,A few times a month,Sometimes,Occasionally,A few times a week,A few times a week,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Neither Agree nor Disagree,Occasionally,Occasionally,Frequently,Sometimes,Neither Agree nor Disagree,"I have one job (my primary employment), which I supplement by working on Mechanical Turk",10+,Retail,501 to 1000,Sales and Related  ,Retail Sales Workers,Retail Salespersons,Junior Individual Contributor
122,"I enjoy my job because my bosses and coworkers are awesome to work with. My team is great and we have a lot of fun at work. Management makes it a great place to work. We have daily, weekly and monthly contests with prizes. They reward us with stuff like food, parties and promotional products. I also like the work I do. It feels great to be able to help our customers when they need it. I enjoy my conversations with them and look forward to going into work.",I stay busy enough on the phone that the calls are back to back. I usually do not get more than a few seconds between phone calls. It makes the day go by faster though and it keeps me busy. So I do not  mind the busy work day. I actually prefer it to being slow and not having any work because then the day goes by slower and I get bored if I am sitting there with nothing to do.,Customer Service Rep,A few times a year,Frequently,Nearly Always,A few times a year,A few times a year,Disagree,Agree,Rarely,Nearly Always,Frequently,Nearly Always,Agree,"I have one job (my primary employment), which I supplement by working on Mechanical Turk",10+,Consumer Goods,Do Not Know,Sales and Related  ,Other Sales and Related Workers,Miscellaneous Sales and Related Workers,Senior Individual Contributor
123,"What I like most about my job is the subjective job performance data. Basically, we are judged on our performance as workers by our sales numbers at the end of the day. Variance exists on any given month, but over the course of many months, and after a year, it's clear who the best sales people are and who works the hardest (and who doesn't work as hard). I love being able to work hard and seeing the results of that work, and knowing that no matter how people may want to judge or critique, or hold a personal bias, nothing can take away from your numbers. If you've outperformed other people, it's because you earned it. There is no office politics, campaigning or brown-nosing when you're judged off the right criteria. You're free to be yourself knowing that managers or coworkers aren't going to hold it against you. In sales, they simply want production. It's reminds me of going to school. The teacher may not like you, and you may not be the most popular, and your study habits may be different than others, but at the end of the day, if you earned the highest grade in the class, nobody can look down on you.","Time does pass by quickly because I'm usually very busy and multi-tasking with 3-5 different things at once. There are handfuls of emails coming in every 10 minutes, the phone is ringing, and I'm working on previous orders or quotes that I need to send off. Having all of those things on your plate at once tends to make the time travel quickly. When things do slow down, I enjoy the break from it all but I can get bored easily. It's like, I hate being swamped and feeling busy, but the one good thing is that all the sudden you look up and the day is almost over. Sales jobs tend to always feel like they day goes by quickly. When you're getting paid on partial commission, you don't let yourself get distracted, since you're only hurting yourself.",inside sales representative,Every week,Rarely,Frequently,A few timems a month,Every week,Somewhat Disagree,Agree,Rarely,Rarely,Occasionally,Sometimes,Somewhat Agree,"I have one job (my primary employment), which I supplement by working on Mechanical Turk",10+,Retail,101 to 500,Sales and Related  ,Other Sales and Related Workers,Miscellaneous Sales and Related Workers,Junior Individual Contributor

125,NA,"A decent chunk of my earnings come from commission, so I have additional incentive to hustle and stay focused on a daily basis. That is, increased focus creates increased income for myself. However, as you can imagine, a traditional bank branch has moments throughout the day that are very slow going. Even though I work for a well know multinational bank, most of the day is slow going unless I have clients that come in by appointment. Thus, I would say a typical day is a filled with a mixture of both fast and slow.",Personal Banker,A few times a month,Occasionally,Occasionally,Monthly,Monthly,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Sometimes,Sometimes,Sometimes,Occasionally,Somewhat Agree,"I have one job (my primary employment), which I supplement by working on Mechanical Turk",10+,Financial Services,Do Not Know,Sales and Related  ,"Sales Representatives, Services","Securities, Commodities, and Financial Services Sales Agents",Junior Individual Contributor
